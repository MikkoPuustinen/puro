About building:

puropd~ should be compiled as a position independent, shared object,
that is, g++ flags -fPIC and -shared.

Resulting file should be made puropd~.pd_linux or puropd~.pd_darwin,
depending on OS.

You have to compile puropd_tilde.cpp with everything in purobase, and some
files in the ICST subdir. I use Eclipse, which takes care of that, and thus
don't have makefile handy.
