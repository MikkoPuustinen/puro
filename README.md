# puro

puro is a template-based C++ sound engine library. It is intended to work as a basis for granular synths, samplers, game audio engines etc.

The library tries to get in your way as little as possible, and merely tries to provide a set of structs and helper functions typically encountered in an audio engine.
As it is also a learning project for good template practices and SFINAE, expect it to break with every commit.

Currently, the examples are mostly broken, as the lib has been in flux as I've adapted it to several project.
