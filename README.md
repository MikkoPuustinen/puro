puro
====

C++ library for massively parallel audio sampling. Puro aims to take the heavy weight-lifting of the developers shoulders, allowing you to focus more on the sounds you want to play, the way you want them to be played, the textures you wan't to create. After implementing several sampling and granular schemes, I started to sketch one library to do it all. 

Currently just a very barebones outline of the architechture for the library. Not much of the designed fancyness is yet implemented. The library is designed in a way, that it can do anything from drum machines to phase vocoding and granulating thounsands of concurrent sounds on real time.
